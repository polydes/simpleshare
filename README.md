# StencylSimple Share via e-mail, Twitter, Facebook etc. Extension (Openfl)

For Stencyl 3.4 and above

Stencyl extension for “Simple Share” on iOS and Android. This extension allows you to easily integrate Simple Share via e-mail, Twitter, Facebook etc. on your Stencyl game / application. (http://www.stencyl.com)

You can share a message with a website and with an image, via all existing apps on a mobile device. This extension use the IMAGE API to share an image.

<span font="color:red;">The website or screenshot will share with Facebook and not the message. All other apps works fine..</span><br/>
It seems that a recent update to the Facebook application has replaced the in-built Facebook share activity with one that ignores status text .

Facebook's policies don't allow you to pre-populate status messages and require all content to be user generated - while I understand the intention behind this, I personally think it is kind of stupid in many cases - For example in my game I want to pre-populate the user's score, but now I can't, so the user is presented with an empty dialog box. I will probably simply remove the Facebook sharing option as no-one will ever use it now.<br/>
